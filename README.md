# Project Limb Rescue
Cancer patients are at risk of lymphedema, a devastating chronic complication. Our overall aim is to develop a product helping patients to monitor the risk of lymphedema. The product marries wearable devices equipped with photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors and our custom software to detect changes in limb characteristics that are concerning for new-onset, or worsening lymphedema. 
Limb Rescue Cloud, constitute of Data Base, Web Tool, and Machine Learning modules, establish connections between software, doctors, and data scientists.
